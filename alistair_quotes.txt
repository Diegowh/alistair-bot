Yes.
Blast it...
Excuse me while I begin projectile vomiting.
Aw, that's sweet.
Is it just me, or did I do really badly back there?
Don't look now, but, well, look now!
I don't think we're alone. Ireallydon't think we're alone.
Look there! Poor slobs. That just seems so excessive.
It's just a guess but I'm thinking everyone in Lothering is aware of the approaching darkspawn horde.
The Chantry is still running the Chanter's Board? Now THAT's dedication!
More crazy? I thought we were all full up.
You ever wonder if that's an accurate likeness of Andraste? Maybe She was ugly. Maybe She had buck teeth. How would we know?
They say you can get anything here. I once got pick-pocketed.
This is where the nobility come to get drunk and debate who's the most self-important of them all. Good times.
Hey! The Wonders of Thedas! Arl Eamon once bought me a miniature golem doll, here... when I was young. Really young.
Where do you think they get all this stuff? Do you think they, um, have any miniature golem dolls?
Why do they call it a 'brothel?' There's no broth. Or is there?
Mmmmmm.... Wet frocks
The arl used to come here in the winter when I was small. I, uh... slept with the hounds.
Err... we're not going to be mobbed, right? That's not something elves do here? Mob people?
Now that is a big tree. I wonder if the children get to climb it?
We're coming here to see the mages, right? Great. They just love me.
Do you ever wonder why the mages built their tower at Lake Calenhad? Do they have an aversion to practicality or something?
As I recall from my time as a templar, locking the door and throwing away the key was 'plan B'. 
You feel that? It's actually colder up here.
This looks like the head enchanter's study, maybe? You think he's read all those?
Do you get the feeling things are just getting worse as we go up?
Now that's just unnecessary.
Can't... keep eyes open. Someone... pinch... me.
Oh, here I am! And there you are! You just disappeared. Well, no matter!
Watch, now. I'm not falling asleep again!
Mages from before the Circle, and before the Chantry held them in check.
It doesn't read like we'll be finding our fair apprentice in one piece.
Can we expect more of those? Because just thinking about the Fade sets my head spinning.
*Sniffs* What is that smell? Fish? And something else. Oh... more fish.
It's just like being home again. Except with more undead.
I locked myself in a cage, once, when I was a child. For an entire day. Ahh, good times.
I've never heard of any village out this way. Is this place even on a proper map?
You hear that? There's people in the chantry. The whole town, maybe.
Makers breath! Look at it all!
Old books. You think any of those might still be readable?
That's Maferath. Andraste's husband, and the one who betrayed her to the Imperium.
That's Archon Hessarian, the magister who ordered Andraste burned to death, and then took mercy on Her at the last second.
We seem to be headingâ€¦ up? Yes, I think these caves are going up to the surface.
A High Dragon is not a joke. We'd best be careful... real careful.
What is this place? It's different from the rest of the ruins.
Uh-oh. I'm terrible at puzzles.
Hey, you see those...thingies over on the side of that huge chasm? I bet they're used for something. Maybe I should touch them. Or stand on them?
Ooh, look at that. I don't think it's solid enough to stand on, but it's a start.
Maker's breath...Andraste only favoured the clever, it seems.
By the Maker, it's... it's the Urn of Sacred Ashes! That's it! That's really it!
I didn't think anyone could succeed in finding Andraste's final resting place... but here... here She is.
How do they move these through the forest? Do the trees just move aside for them?
You know, there are places where these horns fetch a high price. They can cure diseases supposedly.
Let's try not to get lost here. Places like this can get you turned around.
Was there a city here, once? Was it built in the forest, or did the forest come later?
I think this is it, Werewolf City. Kind of a flea heaven, isn't it?
Is this an elven place? Did the elves live under ground just like the dwarves?
I think there's something ahead. Something big.
Most traders aren't allowed into Orzammar, so they just sort of... gather near the doors. There's no laws up here at all, I'm told.
Those statues are dwarven Paragons, if I remember right. The best of their ancestors.
Wow. So this is Orzammar? It's huge!
The deep roads are home to the darkspawn. Oddly they're supposed to be safer to travel during a Blight.
What is that smell? Dwarven vomit? Charming.
I tried dwarven ale once. I thought it was just something they tricked surfacers into drinking, as a joke.
Let me guess: this is where the poor people live?
The Proving Grounds. Blood sport entertainment for the masses, at its best!
So the closer you live to the surface, the higher class you are. Unless you're actuallythe surface.
So how is it the dwarves have a king? I thought they... voted on everything, or something like that?
Huh. That's a lot of lava. I guess they just hope it never erupts?
We have to be getting close. If this Branka has survived, she'll be wary.
I hope you like heroes, my lady, because your husband died like one. or I'm sorry but your husband has fallen in battle. You have my condolences.
And the villagers had no idea they were being watched? Creepy.
He-ey!
Ugh. Down the hole and into the deep. I don't even want to imagine where that leads.
Necessary? Having to relieve yourself after an eight-hour ride is necessary. But there's no excuse for summoning demons.
Looks like we're done here. A demonic invasion thwarted, a Warden base safely rescued. We do good work.
Just how smart are mabari supposed to be, anyway? Do you think they understand everything we say?
Oh, is that so? You could just be listening to the tone of my voice. You could be an utter moron, for all we know.
Hey, now. There's nothing saying that a moron can't be cute and adorable. Who's the cute and adorable puppy?
Ah, Ignorance is bliss, isn't it? That's what the Chantry kept telling me, anyhow.
Do you really know what's going on here? The Blight, the civil war... I really wonder how much of it you understand.
We're all special... big parts to play. Even you. Especially you, in some ways. You are the mabari. You guard one of the most important people--
What?
You... you want to play? But I'm talking. Why doesn't anyone want to hear me talk?
So... let me get this straight. You were a cloistered sister?
I never actually became a templar. I was recruited into the Grey Wardens before I took my final vows.
No, never. Do you?
It used to get so quiet at the monastery that I would start screaming until one of the brothers came running. I would tell them that I was just checking. You never know, right?
Suit yourself. The look on their face was always priceless.
Ooh, that? That's a traditional Fereldan lamb and pea stew. Did you like it?
They didn't make lamb and pea stew for you in Lothering?
Ah, so the last lamb you had was probably cooked Orlesian style. Food shouldn't be frilly and pretentious like that. Now here in Ferelden, we do things right. We take our ingredients, throw them into the largest pot we can find, and cook them for as long as possible until everything is a uniform grey color. As soon as it looks completely bland and unappetizing, that's when I know it's done.
(Laughs) You need to eat in more Fereldan inns.
You know, I've heard about the Orlesian bards.
The stories I heard were a little... racier. It had to do with how a bard assassinated her target. How they were... lulled into complacency.
Oh, I don't know, there's a certain allure to danger, isn't there? And besides, you couldn't all be assassins, could you? I'd take my chances. If the stories were true, that is.
Such as? You're not going to tell me, are you?
I will never get over how quietly you are able to move.
So you didn't sneak around when spying?
Ah, yes, but I heard you often seduced your targets. They'd remember you.
Oh.
I don't know if I should take you seriously... but you scare me sometimes.
So what do you think will happen to all those people we left behind in Lothering?
Don't you wish you could have stayed there? To help more people, I mean?
So it's all right to let some people die for the greater good? I... I'm not so sure about that. I felt bad leaving all those people there, all panicked and helpless.
I've never been very good at that. The steeling myself part. I find it better sometimes to just be a little weak. I'm all right with that, really.
So have you heard? Morrigan and him are... you know.
No, look, he's not even paying attention.
Well, look here, now who's an idle gossip? Me-ow!
So... you're female, Leliana, right?
I just wanted some advice. What should I do if... if I think a woman is special and--
All right, yes. Good point.
Why would they? Especially when I do things like ask women if they're female.
So I should be awkward? Didn't you just say not to do things like that?
All right, forget I asked.
So... this thing you and him have going? Doesn't that violate your vows?
Yes, I'm that blind. I so totally did not see you ogling each other before.
Now that you say it, I'm not sure. Maybe he wasn't ogling you. I don't know... I could always ask him...
I could. But I won't. Next thing you'll have me pulling his hair and passing him love letters.
So I'm wondering something... what exactly does a woman see in a man like Zevran?
No reason. It's just... doesn't he seem to be a bit too much? The hair, the clothing...
Beyond the fact that he's an assassin who's tried to kill us more than once. No... no, not really. Do women go for that sort of thing?
Huh. Really? I see.
I am not lost. Nor, for that matter, a king. And there is nothing glorious about me.
I am the son of a star-struck maid and an indiscreet man who just happened to be king. Look, I can't be king. Some days I have trouble figuring out which boot goes on which foot.
What an utter relief.
And star-struck maids, apparently.
Do I have a choice?
You find that curious, do you?
What do you want to hear? That I prefer to follow? I do.
Couldn't you crawl into a bush somewhere and die? That would be great, thanks.
Leave me alone.
Maybe you'd prefer to lead? That would be worth a good laugh, for a while.
Couldn't you crawl into a bush somewhere and die? That would be great, thanks.
That's directed at me, I take it?
I didn't fail. I was recruited into the Grey Wardens.
I would have turned into a drooling lunatic, slaughtered the grand cleric and run through the streets of Denerim in my small clothes, I guess.
I thought you'd like that.
Yes, well don't worry. It's not what you think.
I was looking at your nose.
I was just thinking that it looks exactly like your mother's.
What?
Have you really been thinking about that all this time?
And not insecure in the slightest, I'm sure.
I don't know. Give it a few hundred years and it'll be a spot-on match.
All right. Got it. Totally different. I see that now.
So let's talk about your mother, for a moment.
There's nothing to talk about. And besides, isn't your mother a scary witch who lives in the middle of a forest? Much more interesting.
You know what's more interesting than that? Apostates. Mages outside of the Tower. That's illegal, you know.
Or we could not talk about your mother. That works for me.
So tell me something, Morrigan. Did you live there in that forest your entire life?
But it was just you and your mother there? No one else?
What? Company? Do I even want to ask?
Why do you always go on about how stupid I am? I'm not stupid, am I?
Because it hurts my manly feelings, you know. All one of them.
I was educated by the Chantry. I studied history. They don't make stupid templars.
No you're not. You're not even listening to me.
All right. I've come up with one, a question that you can't answer.
That's right. You think you're so smart? I've got an academic question that I bet you won't be able to answer.
So tell me, then: what was the name of Andraste's husband?
You're joking, right? A five year-old could answer that question. Do you not know more than a child?
Oh, how the mighty have crumbled.
So what's the deal with you and him, anyway? Dare I ask?
You know exactly who I'm talking about. Mister Let's-Make-Kissy-Faces over there.
What? I'm not jealous! I'm horrified.
These blushing cheeks are terrified that you'll suck all the blood out of them once you're done with him.
That... was so not what I meant.
Uh-huh. I think we're done here.
Caboodle?
What's wrong with fraternizing?
One thing has nothing to do with the other.
That is a... a ridiculous question.
Just the one thing?
I'd figure you'd be the sort who knows all about deception.
Maybe. I guess I was sort of hoping that would go away.
I didn't say it was a good plan.
Half-sister, but yes.
You'd have liked her. You two have a lot in common.
It's moments like this when I truly appreciate the difference between you and me.
Err... yes?
It's moments like this when I truly appreciate the difference between you and me.
Err... yes?
It's moments like this when I truly appreciate the difference between you and me.
So tell me, was the Tower of Magi everything you thought it would be?
You don't think you might have been better off getting your training there? Instead of whatever your mother taught you?
Hmm. I'll give you that one.
Shut up! That is none of your business.
I said shut up! I will run this sword through you, I'm not joking.
This discussion is over.
Soldier's Peak. Looks like it's seen better days. Better centuries more like.
Hey!
Pardon?
I don't know--
--what you're--
What are you going on about?
Are you just making these up right now?
A pair of nose plugs?
What makes you think I haven't?
That proves to be useful, I'm sure.
You have my deepest condolences.
Whose legs?
I didn't do anything with them. I don't know what--
Uhm. Thanks.
So you and Branka were really married?
Of course not. I was raised in the Chantry.
So no pitter-patter of little Oghren feet running around the home cave, I take it?
Wow, she gave up on you, did she? And here you are, a keeper, too.
What? You're... you're drunk, aren't you?
How in the Maker's name do you manage to be constantly drunk? Are we even carrying that much alcohol with us?
A little, yes. Why can't I be drunk all the time? I never get to be drunk.
So... that game you were playing in camp, what was that?
That's Diamondback? I've... heard of it. I thought it was a card game played by dwarven... er...
It's not?
Err... what does that have to do with card games?
I'll... take your word on it.
You think so, do you?
I hesitate to wonder.
Really.
That's disgusting.
I think that's private.
Where people can see you?
Wait, what are you talking about?
(Sigh) Never mind.
Uh...yes, I suppose I have at that.
Then I guess a romance between you and I is completely out of the question?
Well maybe you should ask her why she likes me so much instead of bothering me with it.
Or maybe you just happen to figure she likes me a lot more than she likes you.
Yes, I thought so. Just watch your step or I'm totally telling.
"It" meaning me? Am I an "it," now, too? I feel honored.
Er... thank you?
For a statue, you know a lot of big words.
Have you ever been responsible for someone else's life? Or a lot of other lives? Or an entire nation?
Then... shut... up.
Me? I guess I did, yes. I didn't know all of them that well, however. Mostly just Duncan.
It's... it's not important. You don't need to know who he was.
I would gladly be following Duncan's orders right now, if I could.
You wouldn't understand. Don't worry. I don't expect you to.
So, Shale... when you were standing there all that time? Did you... sleep?
But don't you get bored? Wouldn't you want to dream, at least?
Yes, of course. I thought we allâ€”huh... you watch me?
For... hours and hours?
Well. I won't be doing much of that anymore.
So tell me something... do you feel pain? When you get hit in combat?
Uh... maybe? I've seen you take some bad hits. Don't you feel anything?
I'm not sure. I don't think I'd call it distress, exactly. It's more... (screaming)
That sounds more like a bowel movement. I mean that sharp, stabbing... (screams) Like that?
No? Huh. Good to know.
So do you ever want to go back?
Point taken. Still, if you can't remember anything else ever... it would be scary to leave, I'd think.
Ooh, ow. Ow! Sort of an adventurer, I see. Brave new world, that sort of thing?
Um. Thanks for that. I feel... really good, now.
It looks that way.
Not really, no. We don't always get what we want, however, do we? (If hardened, "I didn't. But I do, now.")
Well, let's be glad you're not king, then.
Ummm, right... just as an aside? This bird fixation? Creepy.
So this... "bird thing" of yours.
But there are some birds that are useful. Like the ones you eat!
They're really quite tasty. you just need to rip off the feathers, first. I like the skin, myself.
Ooh! Golem vomit! This I have to see!
Don't you ever talk? You know, make polite conversation just to put people at ease?
... Nevermind.
Were you really in that cage for twenty days?
What did you do? I mean... twenty days is a long time to sit in one place and do nothing.
Really?
Awww. Too bad. That's got serious potential.
You know, you never did tell me how you passed the time in that cage for so long.
So... what did you do in there?
That... wait. Just wait. You're joking again, aren't you?
You are not telling me that you played, "I Spy," against yourself for twenty days.
Hmmm... I spy with my little eye, something that begins with... "G."
Oooh. You're really good at this.
Are you talking to me?
Why? Are we under attack?
You want to fight me? Just like that?
It is a mystery, I'll admit.
I don't have to prove anything to you. Forget it.
So I suppose once I'm actually king I could end up in negotiations with the Qunari one day.
What do you mean? They negotiated a peace treaty after the war, and as far as I know they've kept to its terms.
And what is the difference between that and negotiating?
But I thought you said your people believed in honor.
It's a sock?
Maybe it likes you? Socks are sneaky like that. Anyway, it's not mine.
Oh. Ha, ha. Ha. Part of templar training, back at the Chantry. The men were... always getting their socks mixed up. Anyway, uh, sorry about that. I'll take it from you right now. One of my socks is feeling a little damp anyway. A change would be nice.
And dry. We're not exactly traveling in the lap of luxury here.
Wynne?
My shirt has a hole in it.
Can you mend it? When we get back to camp?
Sometimes I pick up too much fabric and it ends up all puckered and the entire garment hangs wrong afterward. And you're... you know, grandmotherly. Grandmothers do that sort of thing, don't they? Darning socks and whatnot. You don't want me to have to fight darkspawn in a shirt with a hole, do you? It might get bigger. I might catch a cold.
Ooh! And while you're at it, the elbows kind of need patching too...
Ow.
It itches.
But it's distracting. Can I rub it through the bandage? That's not really scratching.
It won't really fester, will it?
I... uh, I guess it doesn't itch so much now.
So, you... know that I am a Templar, right?
That's right. But I still have... all the abilities of one, of course. That doesn't... make you nervous?
She claims not to be afraid of me... or anything, really. But you've had more experience with the Templars than her. I know how mages can sometimes...
That's... one way of looking at it.
Oh, sure... count on it.
Do you think the tower is ever going to get back to what it was, Wynne?
Do you think you'll be there? To help rebuild, I mean? Once this is all over with?
Why? Because of some grey hair? You are a formidable woman, Wynne. You could see that it happens.
I have a hard time believing that.
So tell me, you have any children? Grandchildren? I don't know, great grandchildren?
You just seem like the grandmotherly type to me, I don't know.
Mages aren't forbidden to marry or anything, are they? It's not such an outlandish question.
How about another mage? There are just as many men as there are women within the Circle, as I recall.
I... all right, suddenly you don't seem quite so grandmotherly to me anymore.
You know, of all the mages I've met you have to be the first one I can honestly say I've really liked.
Your son? I thought you said you were never married?
I... oh. Then this wasn't... before you joined the circle?
Err... yes? Why wouldn't I?
So you... mentioned you had a son? What happened to him?
I... didn't know. I'm sorry.
Couldn't you do something about it?
Do you think about him?
Why are you smiling like that? You look suspiciously like the cat who swallowed the pigeon.
What?
I once had a very large cat, but that's not my point. My point is why are you smirking?
She's our leader. I look to her for guidance.
No no, I wasn't looking at...you know her...hind-quarters
I gazed...glanced, in that direction, maybe, but I wasn't staring...or really seeing anything even.
I hate you. You're a bad person.
Of course, anything for my favouritest mage ever. ("second favorite mage" if player controls a mage character during the dialogue. It can be heard even if the Warden isn't a mage herself)
That's a bit of an overstatement, don't you think?
Pardon?
Andraste's flaming sword! I know where babies come from!
I certainly hope so.
You did that on purpose!
Because you're wicked. That frail old lady act? I'm so not fooled. I'm on to you now.
Soooo, what would you do if someone told you that they loved you?
No. I mean, pretend you're a woman...
Ahhh, that's... not what I meant. Just... pretend you're another woman. And someone told you that they loved you. How would you react?
I... I don't know if you love them back. Maybe you do. You've... spent a lot of time with this person.
Oh, I wasn't talking about me... just... forget I said anything.
Not this again. I'm ready this time.
Oh, yes, I bet you are, indeed.
And?
Really? No pinching my cheeks? No making me blush?
Not even pinching my cheeks a little?
So you know about him and Morrigan, right? You've heard?
And you agree with it? You don't think that it's... dangerous?
Anyone. She's maleficar... and rotten to the core. How can he even... this can't be a good idea. She can't be a good influence on him.
You know, you are just too understanding about stuff like this. Can't you be more judgmental? I'm trying to rant, here.
You're asking me if I have a relationship with my "brother", aren't you?
I don't think he cared much about my existence. I didn't mean anything to him. Anyway, to answer your original question, no, we never spoke. Well, maybe once. Maric and Cailan had come to Redcliffe to visit the arl. I was very young then. We were introduced. I believe I said, "Greetings, your Highness." He said, "Ooh! Swords!" and ran off to the armory. So, yes, that was the extent of our relationship. We drifted apart after that. Very sad.
Something about returning here makes me feel old, Wynne.
What? Nothing! I just thought...
I just mean that I was a different person then. I believed in him, you know? That it would be a glorious battle, that we'd win...
Well, not you. You've always been old.
I don't know. It just feels wrong to find this here, pawed over by darkspawn and thick with their rot. It was.
Yes but this wound cuts deeper.
So it's true! He had convinced the forces of Orlais to ally against the darkspawn.
A response that never came and now never will, thanks to Loghain's treachery.
Well I hope you live to see it, Wynne.
There it is, the last of them.
And if I may say so, milady, you appear to be getting younger by the day.
Beside you?
Are all women this evil and conniving when they grow old?
I was raised in a castle. I was schooled in the abbey. As far as being religious... I don't know. Not especially. What about you? Not in your line of work, I expect.
Truly? But you kill people. For money.
But... you ask forgiveness and then you go right on with your sinning?
I... have no idea.
So why would the Crows send you, Zevran?
Plenty of reasons. Starting with the fact that you weren't exactly the best they had, were you?
I'm not an idiot. Well, not most of the time. You're no raw recruit, but I've seen you fight. You're no master of combat, by any means.
But the Crows must have master assassins, the way you describe them. Men with years and years of experience. Why not send them?
Oh, I get it. You're not going to tell me.
You didn't answer my question. About why the Crows wouldn't send their best man.
If you aren't telling me, there must be a reason.
Best bid?
And they thought you were worthy?
Were there many who wanted the contract?
Well, that's comforting, somehow.
So those... designs you have all over your back...
Err... right. I hear that someone gets those by having needles put the ink under your skin?
Didn't that hurt?
Oh, no. No, I don't think so.
Um... maybe some other time. I'm... I'm going to go stand over here, now.
The stories we hear down here about the Crows... they're not true, are they? They all sound a little far-fetched.
A dog? No, of course not. We value our dogs, it's part of our history.
*Laughs* Well, now that you mention it...
Really. Even the ones that talk about how you all... you know... get paid to...
Wow. I am totally in the wrong order.
I've been thinking about those ink drawings, what did you call them? Tattoos? Are you... still willing to do one?
I'm not worried about that. I think they look interesting, though I'd want mine... smaller. When can you do it?
You need to... bathe me? That seems... odd.
The... massage? You're... having me on, aren't you?
Hmm. No. No, on second thought I'll just pass.
As a Crow, you were an assassin in Antiva, right? Professionally?
So how much did you charge to... you know... kill someone? Was it very expensive? Did it depend on who they were?
No, neither. It just seems odd to me that you could make a living doing that. Or that you would need an entire guild just to handle so many... jobs.
Five thousand andris? Is that a lot?
So I have a question for you, Zevran. You're here, at least in part, to get away from the Crows, right?
So when this is over, what do you intend to do with yourself? You can't go back to Antiva, I assume.
Yes, yes, but what if you could do whatever you wanted?
So you do intend to go back to the Crows?
Why don't I believe you?
I probably do, yes.
That's assuming I would hire you.
And people wonder why someone might not want to be king.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Fair enough. Have you... had very many women in your time? I mean... you seem like the sort of man who would...
Right. Well, how do you... woo them? Is there a... technique? Or...
Er... yes? I don't know what else to call it.
All right. Bad idea. Never mind.
I like my hair the way it is, thank you.
My...? Oh.
We aren't talking about this, are we? Did I hit my head?
Whoa! Whoa! Awkward!
Not listening! La la la la la!
So let me ask you something. What are your intentions with her?
Don't dodge the question. I'm serious.
I am just asking what your intentions are. You did try to kill us all, remember?
Is that a smirk? Are you smirking at me?
Well, just... watch yourself, then. I'll be keeping an eye on you.
So let me ask you something. What are your intentions with her?
Don't dodge the question. I'm serious.
I am just asking what your intentions are. You did try to kill us all, remember?
Is that a smirk? Are you smirking at me?
Well, just... watch yourself, then. I'll be keeping an eye on you.
You don't say?
Well aren't you just chock full of useless trivia today.
Let me guess: they get assassinated?
And the unpopular ones?
Couldn't afford him, I take it?
So what do you have to say about me becoming king? I suppose you don't care?
Unusual? I guess it was a bit... unorthodox, even by our standards. Why? How does a king get picked in Antiva?
Yes, from what you said that seems to happen a lot there. Makes me wonder why anyone would even want to be king.
And what happens then?
I am a prince of Ferelden, I'm telling you!
That's because it's true!
Just leave me alone. I've had enough of people like you. You're all the same.
No, not okay! Worse than okay. Disgraced traitor, that's what I am.
I don't need another drink. Okay, maybe I do. But just one. Or two.
Right. I'll shut up. Don't speak out! Don't tell anyone that a traitor should die, oh no.
You sound like Morrigan.
Yes, I'm still here! What do you want from me?
Go away, Teagan.
And what am I supposed to do?
(Sighs)
Hoo! On the list of things I thought might happen today, a Qunari attack would have been near the bottom. Thank you for your help, I don't think we've met. My name is Alistair. I'd like nothing better than to stay and help, but... unfortunately the mission we're on can't be delayed.
Well, you wouldn't think so, right? I'm afraid there are larger things afoot. I can't say more than that. I wish I could, but I swore on my pinky to keep the Warden's secrets.
Hm. I get that a lot.
Even if I didn't need to go, Grey Wardens aren't supposed to involve themselves in wars like this. We did that in Ferelden, after all. The order was not impressed, let me tell you. Here, maybe this might help? It belongs to an old friend, but I'm willing to bet she'd/he'd like you to have it. Maker watch over you, my friend. And over us all.

It's a big list. I like to be prepared. Thank you for your help, I don't think we've met. My name is Alistair. I'd like nothing better than to stay and help, but... unfortunately the mission we're on can't be delayed.

Let me guess: that's your final answer?
A "maybe" might have been nice.

Well. That was awkward.
I've been better. Manlier too, come to think of it.
Really? Kirkwall brutality must rip the skin off your face, then.
I did! Or I think I did, anyhow.
Right! I'm Alistair, uh... king of Ferelden. And this is Teagan, my uncle. Sort of.
You could, but you'd be the first today.
Ah. Yes. Yes, it was. Thankfully the man responsible has paid for that.
Ah. Yes, Yes, it was, sadly Loghain still lives.
That's the rumor. Wait, weren't you...?
Huh. I guess we get around.
Yes. I wish I could say that went better.
It's... a long story. I intend to make it up to your people, however. I owe an old friend of mine too much to do otherwise.
Isabela, right? You look... different.
(Ah) Isabela. Yes, I remember you.
(Chuckles) Uh, well, I... Who knows?
I was hoping we could talk. Would've been better timing before being emasculated by Meredith, but I'm not picky.
I know you came here from Lothering. A Fereldan refugee that did well for himself/herself, against all odds.
I have to admit. I was hoping your influence in Kirkwall might be of use.
Things... haven't been going well with Orlais. Without a viscount here, however, there's only the knight-commander to deal with.
Yes, well, apparently I don't feel the same way about mages as the Chantry does.
So we're in disagreement. That means they get nasty. They're like that.
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
Sadly. I don't control the Circle. I can only deal with mages outside the Circle... of which there aren't many.
Ha! Easier said than done!
We'll see what comes of it. Ferelden had a Blight to contend with, remember? We're not exactly at our strongest.

I know. I wish I could have helped them.
The Blight devastated the kingdom, and afterwards... well, it hasn't exactly been peaceful.
They're welcome back, of course. As are you. But after so many years away, would you still consider it home?
I hope we see you back there someday. We could use someone like you. Champion.
I understand. Ferelden's loss.
I hope not!
Empress Celene is doing her best. Orlais isn't the most stable place right now.
Oh, the usual. Attempted assassinations, uprisings, fancy parties with stinky cheeses.
Apparently, some Orlesians think it would be grand to get their lost province back.
That's right. Swooping is bad.

Sadly, it may be too late. Meredith got wind of my arrival sooner than I'd hoped.
It's tempting. But I'm sorry to say that my support won't mean much without the support of the templars.
I suppose it doesn't matter. I was hoping to have your help before Meredith got wind of my arrival, but that's done now.
It's all right, Teagan. I wish we could have done more.
I suppose it doesn't matter. I was hoping to have your help before Meredith got wind of my arrival, but that's done now.
What you can do is protect Kirkwall. It will take someone like you to keep it from falling apart.
You ask me, the biggest threat to this city just walked out the door.
But maybe that's the ex-templar in me talking.
I've been there. Trust me, it isn't pretty.
Well that's comforting.
Well. I suppose we should be getting back.
You're always so formal. He/She has a name, you know.
Well. I suppose we should be getting back.
With more questions I'll bet, lovely.
Well. I suppose we should be getting back.
Is she? Well, the day's looking up already.
Is she? Well, let's not tell the queen then.
Well, I suppose I should get back to the old ball and chain.
No she doesn't. Just because she killed an Archdemon... she doesn't scare me.
Being around you, Mirwen, makes even the darkest days in Thedas seem bright and full of hope.
If I were to face a thousand darkspawn or a horde of demons, I'd still be brave as long as I know you're waiting for me, Mirwen.
Mirwen... always a pleasure.
